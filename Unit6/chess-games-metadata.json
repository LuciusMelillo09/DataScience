With it\u0027s more than 4 GB of information this can be a good opportunity to work with a huge dataset and practice on how to handle it.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains 6.25 Million chess games played on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) during July of 2016.\nSome of the games have Stockfish analysis evaluations like* [%eval 2.35] (235 centipawn advantage)* always from White\u0027s point of view. These are evaluations of the movement made by a player.\n\n**- Event:** Game type.\n**- White:** White\u0027s ID.\n**- Black:** Black\u0027s ID.\n**- Result:** Game Result (1-0 White wins) (0-1 Black wins)\n**- UTCDate:** UTC Date.\n**- UTCTime:** UTC Time.\n**- WhiteElo:** White\u0027s ELO.\n**- BlackElo:** Black\u0027s ELO.\n**- WhiteRatingDiff:** White\u0027s rating points difference after the game.\n**- BlackRatingDiff:** Blacks\u0027s rating points difference after the game.\n**- ECO:** Opening in [ECO encoding. ](https://www.365chess.com/eco.php) \n**- Opening:** Opening name.\n**- TimeControl:** Time of the game for each player in seconds. The number after the increment is the number of seconds before the player\u0027s clock starts ticking in each turn.\n**- Termination:** Reason of the game\u0027s end.\n**- AN:** Movements in Movetext format.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe original data has been published by [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/).\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWhich is the best opening?\nWhich openings are common depending on the ELO?\nWhich are the more efficient openings? \nWhat are the more frequent moves?\nDoes the playstyle change in short games?"}
